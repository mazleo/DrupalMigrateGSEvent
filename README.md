# Drupal Migration Script

Extracts information from Drupal 6 Grad Study event pages and migrates it to Drupal 7 create event fields.

This program requires Internet Explorer (which works in the background as COM) and works best with Chrome and Firefox as the main browsers to open the Grad Study pages, as IE COM tends to become buggy when too many Internet Explorer windows are open. This script has not been tested on Safari.

To use, simply have the Drupal 7 create event page on one window and the Drupal 6 edit page on a separate window (in Chrome). The script will provide the user with initial help on how to use it when it is first run.

+ Press Ctrl + Alt + D to start the script
+ Press Enter while the Drupal 6 page is active to start the migration process.
+ Press Ctrl + Alt + F10 to close the script

*Note: Due to inconsistency with the source code on some Drupal 6 pages, the program is unable to work correctly; though, it is not very common.*
