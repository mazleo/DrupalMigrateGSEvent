# Drupal Migration Script

Extracts information from Drupal 6 event pages and migrates it to Drupal 7 create event fields.

This program requires Internet Explorer (which works in the background as COM) and was written mainly using Chrome. Firefox and Safari has not been tested.

To use, simply have the Drupal 7 create event page on one window and the Drupal 6 edit page on a separate, active window (in Chrome).
